    "Before I get more into that, a huge thank you to @kennyflorian for being so patient and sharing his vast knowledge of this art with me. I’m forever grateful for his time and pushing me to be better. I walked into his and @jhuntbjj’s gym @merakibjj completely clueless, lost and probably at my worst.. ",
    "After my first few classes, I wanted to quit more than anything. It was uncomfortable. I felt so stupid for not knowing anything at all (I still feel stupid but I’ve reframed that thought as a positive — the willingness to learn). ",
    "It’s definitely been the most difficult thing I’ve ever decided to do, which has helped immensely in my day to day life. If you’re starting your day fighting for your life, how can you not handle what the rest of the day will throw at you?",
    "About 5 or so months in I got my first real injury (which I never told you guys how I got). It set me back 6+ months and to this day it still hasn’t healed properly. I had to turn down jobs because I couldn’t walk for weeks. I was considering never going back because this healing process was so miserable.. but all I could think about was going back.",
    "So, instead of quitting.. I found other things I could do like knife training with @methods_of_movement and yoga with @mychalangelo 🙏🏻 I even got into running which is probably the opposite of what I should have done with how severe my toe injury was.",
    "This injury made me take a step back and realize I wasn’t invincible and I had to take my health more seriously. ",
    "I have posted almost my entire life online in some form for the past 20 years which is insane to think about. As much as I’ve loved sharing everything with the internet, I was at a point where I did absolutely nothing for myself. It became about what I could post online for that days content. I was always starting and quitting a new hobby.",
    "I really wanted this to be different — I wanted to do this for me. I didn’t want the criticism or encouragement of the internet. I needed to be the one to give both of those things to myself. I also never wanted to walk into training with the distraction of even thinking about making content."
